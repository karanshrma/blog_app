Flutter Clean Architecture Blog App
A robust, full-stack blog application built using Flutter and Supabase, meticulously structured with Clean Architecture and designed with SOLID Principles in mind. The goal of this project was to create a scalable, testable, and maintainable application while delivering a smooth, offline-first user experience.
‚ú® Key Architectural Highlights
Clean Architecture: Strict separation of concerns across Data, Domain, and Presentation layers for maximum modularity and testability.
SOLID Principles: Adherence to principles like Dependency Inversion (implemented via GetIt) to ensure flexible and maintainable code.
State Management: Utilizes BLoC (Business Logic Component) for predictable, event-driven state management.
Offline-First Experience: Integration of Hive local database and network monitoring allows users to access content even without an internet connection.

üìÅ Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed
A Supabase account
1. Supabase Setup
   Create a New Project in your Supabase dashboard.
   Database Tables: Create the necessary tables (e.g., blogs, users) as required by the application's domain model.
   Storage Buckets: Set up a storage bucket for saving blog post images.
2. Configure Environment
   Clone this repository:
   git clone [https://github.com/karanshrma/blog_app.git](https://github.com/karanshrma/blog_app.git)
   cd blog_app


In the project, locate the file where global constants/configuration is stored (e.g., core/utils/constants.dart).
Replace the placeholder values with your Supabase credentials:
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
3. Run the App
   Install dependencies:
   flutter pub get


Run the application on a connected device or emulator:
flutter run
