# Flutter Clean Architecture Blog App

A robust, full-stack blog application built using **Flutter** and **Supabase**, meticulously structured with Clean Architecture and designed with SOLID Principles in mind. The goal of this project was to create a scalable, testable, and maintainable application while delivering a smooth, offline-first user experience.

## ‚ú® Key Architectural Highlights
* **Clean Architecture:** Strict separation of concerns across Data, Domain, and Presentation layers for maximum modularity and testability.
* **SOLID Principles:** Adherence to principles like Dependency Inversion (implemented via GetIt) to ensure flexible and maintainable code.
* **State Management:** Utilizes BLoC (Business Logic Component) for predictable, event-driven state management.
* **Offline-First Experience:** Integration of Hive local database and network monitoring allows users to access content even without an internet connection.
